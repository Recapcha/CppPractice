# CppPractice

# C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects I created while learning the language and preparing to work with Unreal Engine. It includes fundamental data structures, custom utilities, math for game development, and later will include UE-related code and patterns.

## 📁 Structure

- `linked_list/` — A simple implementation of a singly linked list.
- `my_string/` — A custom string class to understand memory and character handling.
- `math/` — (Coming soon) Vector and matrix math for game development.
- `ue_projects/` — (Coming soon) C++ practice projects based on Unreal Engine.
- `design_patterns/` — (Planned) Game-oriented design pattern examples in C++.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen my C++ fundamentals.
- Practice writing clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Build a solid base before diving deep into Unreal Engine development.

## 🛠 Tools & Standards

- C++17
- Clean code principles (naming, structure, modularity)
- Upcoming: SOLID principles and game programming patterns

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is constantly updated as I continue learning and building more advanced systems.
