Creating a String class in C++

Creating constructors

    //constructor with parameters, when creating a class object, you must forward the string that it will store

    //copy constructor, necessary to create an exact copy of a class object, but in a different memory area

    //overloaded assignment constructor, called when it is necessary to assign the value of one object to another

    //the overloaded addition operator, in the current implementation of the String class, is necessary for string concatenation. Combining lines into one

    //displacement constructor, a link to a link to an object. An address for a variable that stores another address.

Destructors 

Methods 

    //outputs a string to the console. Ideally, operator overloading is necessary for this <<

Operator overload 

    //an overloaded comparison operator compares two strings, first whether their lengths are correct to each other, then whether at least one element is character-by-character different from each other

    //the overloaded operator is not equal, returns the inverse value of the comparison operator

    //overloaded indexing operator
